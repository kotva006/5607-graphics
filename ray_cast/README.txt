Ray Tracer

Inoder to work the ray tracer the following needs to be done:
1. 'make all' will compile the code and then make the executable called 'ray'
2. to run the executable do the following: './ray sample.in'
   where sample.in is any scene file.
3. This executable then creates a ppm file with the same name as you input
   file followed by .ppm. Example if the input file was sample.in then the
   output file would be called sample.in.ppm

The files I supplied are sample.in and sample.2.in
sample.2.in was the file that I created, and sample.in was the one supplied.
The output files of the 2 test files are found in sample.in.ppm and 
sample.2.in.ppm

Part B:

The write up is in a file called write_up.txt
The test files for this iteration are test* where * is any number
The pictures these files generated are test*.ppm
